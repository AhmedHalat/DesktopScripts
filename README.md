# DesktopScripts
A few scripts I run on my desktop with Geektool

## Setup
1. Install Geektool on your mac and drag a new "Shell" geeklet anywhere onto your desktop.
2. With the customization popup, Press the "..." next to the command text field to get an Edit Script popup
3. Copy and paste the sh script that you want into the window, press CMD-S to save, then quit
4. Update the Style part (below the command section) of the Geeklet setting to fully customize the script

DONE!
